## Main Game Repository

Please be sure to branch off of the master in order to implement new features and design aspects.

#### This repository has been manually forked from https://github.com/KurtShumaker/NinjaCat and had missing prefabs reconnected. If you experience any issues with this repository, please submit a bug report.

#### To avoid missing prefab/behavior errors, be sure to move, rename, and delete files _only within the Unity Editor!_ Meta files are incredibly volatile. https://blog.forrestthewoods.com/managing-meta-files-in-unity-713166ee3d30
